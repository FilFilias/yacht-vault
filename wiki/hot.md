## Current Focus

Backend architecture stress-tested and simplified for solo developer. 6 scope decisions locked in (2026-05-27). Ready to start scaffolding (Milestone 1).

## Recent Decisions (2026-05-27 — architecture simplification)

- Platform name: **YachtBay** (temporary — to be revisited)
- Launch market: **Greece only**
- Booking model: **Instant book**
- Revenue: **~13% commission from owners** (exact rate under analysis)
- Crew options: **Bareboat, skippered, fully crewed** — defined per yacht by owner
- Charter types: **Day trips + multi-day/weekly**
- Target customer: **Mid-range travelers** (primary)
- Payments: **Stripe Connect Accounts v2** — destination charges, synchronous capture inside booking transaction, payout 24–48h after charter start
- Geo search: **Lat/lng + haversine SQL** — PostGIS deferred to scale
- Events: **Synchronous emails via EmailPort** — outbox table in schema, poller deferred
- Queues: **payout-queue only** — Redis from Milestone 4, other queues deferred
- CQRS: **Booking module only** — other modules use plain NestJS services
- Admin: **4 endpoints at MVP** — full admin panel post-traction

## Vault Status

- [x] 4 decision records written
- [x] Roadmap stub created
- [x] wiki/index.md initialized
- [x] Stripe Connect research documented
- [x] MVP scope defined — [[specs/mvp-scope]]
- [x] Competitor research complete — [[wiki/concepts/competitor-analysis]]
- [x] Backend tech stack decided — [[wiki/concepts/tech-stack]]

## Open Questions

- What is the exact default commission rate? (~13% but needs final confirmation)
- What is the final platform name?

## Next Steps

1. **Start Milestone 1 scaffolding** — NestJS + Fastify + Prisma + PostgreSQL + auth + Turborepo + Railway
2. ~~Product design~~ → design brief created at [[specs/design/stitch-brief]] — feed into Google Stitch when M1 is complete
3. Connect Google Stitch MCP to Claude Code to transform UI into React Router 7 SSR code
