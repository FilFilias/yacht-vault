# Phase 1 — Development Roadmap (MVP)

**Summary**: Build order for the YachtBay MVP — 7 milestones from project scaffolding to launch-ready. Each milestone produces a testable, shippable increment.

**Principle**: Backend first, frontend follows. Never build a frontend feature before the API it depends on is complete and tested. Each milestone ends with a clear "what you can now test" checkpoint.

---

## Milestone 1 — Foundation
*Goal: Three deployed apps, auth working end-to-end*

### Backend
- [ ] NestJS project initialized with Fastify adapter
- [ ] Prisma configured, PostgreSQL connected, first migration run (full schema from [[specs/data-model]])
- [ ] PostGIS extension enabled
- [ ] Redis connected, BullMQ configured (no workers yet — just the connection)
- [ ] Global pipes (ValidationPipe), guards, and error filter wired up
- [ ] Auth module: `register`, `verify-email`, `login`, `refresh`, `logout`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`
- [ ] Users module: `GET /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me`, `add-owner-role`
- [ ] JWT strategy + `JwtAuthGuard` + `RolesGuard`
- [ ] `.env.example` committed

### Frontend
- [ ] Turborepo monorepo initialized (`apps/backend`, `apps/storefront`, `apps/owner-panel`, `packages/ui`, `packages/types`, `packages/api-client`)
- [ ] Storefront: React Router 7 SSR initialized, basic layout shell
- [ ] Storefront: auth pages (`/register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`)
- [ ] Owner panel: React Router 7 SPA initialized, basic layout shell
- [ ] Owner panel: auth pages (`/login`, `/register`)
- [ ] Shared `api-client` package with auth endpoints wired up

### Infrastructure
- [ ] GitHub repo created, monorepo pushed
- [ ] Railway: 3 services created (backend, storefront, owner-panel)
- [ ] Railway: PostgreSQL + Redis provisioned and connected to backend
- [ ] GitHub Actions: CI workflow (typecheck + lint on PR)
- [ ] GitHub Actions: deploy to Railway on push to `main`
- [ ] Domains configured: `api.yachtbay.com`, `yachtbay.com`, `owners.yachtbay.com`

### ✅ Milestone 1 checkpoint
> Can register → verify email → log in → view profile → log out → reset password on both storefront and owner panel. Three apps deployed and auto-deploying from GitHub.

---

## Milestone 2 — Listings
*Goal: Owner can create, configure, and publish a yacht listing*

### Backend
- [ ] Yachts module: `POST /yachts`, `GET /yachts/:id`, `PATCH /yachts/:id`, `PATCH /yachts/:id/status`, `DELETE /yachts/:id`
- [ ] Slug generation on listing creation
- [ ] Yacht photos: pre-signed R2 upload URL flow, `POST /yachts/:id/photos`, reorder, delete
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 adapter wired up (`R2Adapter` implementing `StoragePort`)
- [ ] Pricing configuration: `PATCH /yachts/:id/pricing` — creates `pricing_rules` for crew options + weekly rate
- [ ] Configuration: `PATCH /yachts/:id/configuration` — crew options, charter types, prep days

### Frontend (Owner Panel)
- [ ] `/listings` — all listings page
- [ ] `/listings/new/*` — 6-step creation wizard:
  - Step 1: Basic details + Mapbox location picker
  - Step 2: Photo upload (drag-and-drop, R2 direct upload)
  - Step 3: Pricing
  - Step 4: Crew options + charter types
  - Step 5: Availability settings (prep days, min duration)
  - Step 6: Review & publish (blocked until Stripe active — shows prompt)
- [ ] `/listings/:id` — listing overview
- [ ] `/listings/:id/edit`, `/listings/:id/photos`, `/listings/:id/pricing`, `/listings/:id/configuration`

### ✅ Milestone 2 checkpoint
> Owner can create a full listing (details, photos, pricing, crew options), save as draft, and attempt to publish (blocked by Stripe — connects in Milestone 4). Listing detail visible via `GET /yachts/:id`.

---

## Milestone 3 — Discovery
*Goal: Renter can search and find yachts on the storefront*

### Backend
- [ ] Availability module: `GET /yachts/:id/availability`, `POST /yachts/:id/availability/block`, `DELETE /yachts/:id/availability/block`
- [ ] PREP day auto-blocking on booking confirmation (written now, triggered in Milestone 4)
- [ ] Search module: `GET /yachts` with PostGIS geo filter, date availability join, crew option filter, price filter, sort
- [ ] `GET /yachts/:id/pricing` — PricingEngine with `BasePriceStrategy`, `WeeklyRateStrategy`, `CrewOptionStrategy`

### Frontend (Storefront)
- [ ] Homepage (`/`) — hero with search bar, featured listings section, how it works, trust signals
- [ ] Search page (`/search`) — listing cards + Mapbox map split view, filters, sort, pagination
- [ ] Yacht detail page (`/yachts/:id`) — photo gallery, specs, booking widget with dynamic price preview, availability calendar, owner card, cancellation policy
- [ ] Shared `ui` package: Button, Input, Card, Badge, DatePicker components

### Frontend (Owner Panel)
- [ ] `/listings/:id/availability` — availability calendar with date blocking UI

### ✅ Milestone 3 checkpoint
> End-to-end discovery flow: owner creates listing → renter searches by location + dates → finds the listing → views full detail page with live price calculation. Map pins show yacht home ports.

---

## Milestone 4 — Booking Core
*Goal: Renter can instant-book a yacht and payment is processed*

### Backend
- [ ] Stripe Connect module: `POST /stripe/connect/onboard`, `GET /stripe/connect/status`, `GET /stripe/connect/dashboard-link`
- [ ] Stripe webhook handler: `account.updated` → updates `stripe_account_status` on user
- [ ] BullMQ workers: email-queue, payment-queue, host-queue, audit-queue
- [ ] Transactional outbox poller (`@nestjs/schedule` — polls every 2s)
- [ ] Resend adapter wired up (`ResendAdapter` implementing `EmailPort`)
- [ ] Bookings module: `POST /bookings` (full CreateBookingCommand — `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, pricing, payment, outbox event)
- [ ] Bookings module: `GET /bookings`, `GET /bookings/:id`
- [ ] Stripe webhook handler: `payment_intent.succeeded` → booking confirmed, outbox event delivered

### Frontend (Storefront)
- [ ] `/yachts/:id/checkout` — booking summary page
- [ ] `/yachts/:id/checkout/pay` — Stripe Elements payment form
- [ ] `/bookings/:id/confirmed` — booking confirmation page
- [ ] Auth redirect flow: unauthenticated renter hitting checkout → login → return to checkout

### Frontend (Owner Panel)
- [ ] `/settings/stripe` — Stripe Connect status + onboarding CTA
- [ ] Stripe onboarding button → redirect to Stripe → return with success message
- [ ] Publish listing now unblocked once Stripe active

### ✅ Milestone 4 checkpoint
> Full booking flow: owner connects Stripe → publishes listing → renter searches → finds yacht → instant books → payment captured → renter gets confirmation email → owner gets notification email → availability locked.

---

## Milestone 5 — Operations
*Goal: Full charter lifecycle, cancellations, payouts, and both dashboards working*

### Backend
- [ ] Bookings module: `PATCH /bookings/:id/cancel` — refund calculation + Stripe refund + availability release
- [ ] Bookings module: `PATCH /bookings/:id/check-in`, `PATCH /bookings/:id/complete`
- [ ] Payments module: `GET /payments` (owner payout history)
- [ ] Payout scheduler: auto-release 24–48h after charter start (`@nestjs/schedule`)
- [ ] Cancellation emails: renter + owner notification on cancellation
- [ ] Completion emails: owner + renter notification on completion

### Frontend (Storefront)
- [ ] `/bookings` — renter bookings dashboard (Upcoming / Past / Cancelled tabs)

---

## Milestone 6 — Admin
*Goal: Admin panel operational, platform manageable without code deploys*

### Backend
- [ ] Admin module: all endpoints from [[specs/api-contract]] §8
  - Users: list, detail, suspend, reactivate, set commission rate
  - Listings: list, detail, pause, delete
  - Bookings: list, detail, trigger payout, issue refund
  - Revenue: summary + monthly breakdown

- [ ] `/login` — admin login
- [ ] `/dashboard` — platform overview + alerts panel
- [ ] `/users` + `/users/:id` — user management with suspend/reactivate/commission

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests: PricingEngine strategies, CancellationPolicyStrategy, CreateBookingCommand
- [ ] Integration tests: booking creation (availability lock, double-booking prevention)
- [ ] E2E smoke test: register → search → book → cancel (Playwright or manual)

### Launch
- [ ] Production environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] Custom domains verified and SSL active
- [ ] Stripe account in live mode (not test mode)
